Playwright is a modern automation framework for web testing
Playwright is a modern automation framework for web testing
With Playwright and TypeScript, you can write efficient and maintainable end-to-end tests for web applications, covering a wide range of browsers and scenarios. 

Selenium with Java allows you to create and execute tests that interact with web applications, automate tasks, and validate user scenarios. It offers compatibility with a wide array of browsers, making it a valuable tool for cross-browser testing.
Both Playwright with TypeScript and Selenium with Java have their unique advantages, and the choice between them often depends on your specific project requirements, your team's expertise, and your preference for the language and ecosystem you're more comfortable with. These combinations empower automation engineers to ensure the quality and reliability of web applications across various platforms and scenarios.

## Here are some common use cases of Playwright & Selenium in a project:
1. End-to-End Testing (E2E): Playwright is widely used for automating end-to-end tests, ensuring that an application behaves as expected from the user's perspective. It can simulate user interactions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating through pages to validate the application's functionality.
2. Regression Testing: Playwright can be employed to automate regression tests, which help ensure that recent code changes or updates haven't introduced new defects or negatively impacted existing features. By running automated tests regularly, you can catch regressions early in the development cycle.
3. Performance Testing: While not a dedicated performance testing tool, Playwright can be used to measure web performance indirectly. You can track page load times, monitor resource loading, and capture performance-related metrics to assess your application's speed and efficiency.
4. UI and Visual Testing: Playwright enables UI testing by automating interactions with UI components. It also supports visual testing by capturing screenshots or comparing the appearance of page elements against expected visuals. This helps ensure the correct rendering of your application.
5. Accessibility Testing: Playwright includes features for accessibility testing. You can use it to assess your application's compliance with web accessibility standards like WCAG and identify potential accessibility issues that could affect users with disabilities.
6. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD): Playwright can be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically when code changes are committed. This ensures that the application works as expected after each build and deployment, helping maintain a high level of quality.
7. Data-Driven Testing: Playwright can be used for data-driven testing, where you feed different sets of data to your test scripts to validate the application's behavior under various conditions and scenarios.
